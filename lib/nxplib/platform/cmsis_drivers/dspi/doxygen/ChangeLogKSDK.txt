@section dspi_cmsis DSPI_CMSIS
  Current dspi_cmsis driver version is 2.1

  - 2.0
    - - Initial version.

  - 2.1
    - Bug Fix:
      - Fix the wrong clock polarity assignment in driver. 
        For ARM_SPI_CPOL0_CPHA0 and other frame format parameters, CPOL = 0 menas kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveHigh
        not kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveLow in driver.
        
    - New feature:
	  - Allow user to set up the default Transmit value by using ARM_SPI_SET_DEFAULT_TX_VALUE.
      - Enable slave select mode in the new driver, but this has no effect when user set any of them because
        the driver can only support the hardware control function.
