@section lpspi_cmsis LPSPI_CMSIS
  Current LPSPI_CMSIS driver version is 2.1

  - 2.1
    - Bug Fix:
      - Fix the incorrect clock polarity assignment in the driver. 
        For ARM_SPI_CPOL0_CPHA0 and other frame format parameters, CPOL = 0 means kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveHigh
        not kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveLow in driver.

    - New feature:
      - Allow user to set up the default Transmit value by using ARM_SPI_SET_DEFAULT_TX_VALUE.
        Please note that set default value is not supported in slave interrupts, because the pin will stay
        tristated if TX buffer is NULL.
        
      - Enable slave select mode in the new driver, but this has no effect when users set any of them because
        the driver can only support the hardware control function.
		
	  - Enable 3-Wire mode, users can use ARM_SPI_MODE_MASTER_SIMPLEX/ARM_SPI_MODE_SLAVE_SIMPLEX to enable this 
	    feature. For ARM_SPI_MODE_MASTER_SIMPLEX mode, select SOUT pin as the input/output pin,
		and for ARM_SPI_MODE_SLAVE_SIMPLEX, the SIN pin is selected as the input/output pin.

  - 2.0
    - - Initial version.
