====================================

The operations listed in this section produce conflicting results in MicroPython when 
compared to standard Python.

**Python 3.5** 

Given below is a list of PEPs (in progress) grouped to their impact to MicroPython.

* Extension to the syntax:

	* `PEP 448 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/>`_ : additional unpacking generalizations 

* Standard library changes:

	* `PEP 471 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/>`_ : os.scandir() 

* Miscellaneous changes

	* `PEP 441 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/>`_ : improved Python zip application support
	
	* `PEP 486 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0486/>`_ : make the Python Laucher aware of virtual environments

	* `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ : type hints (advisory only)

	* `PEP 488 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0488/>`_ : elimination of PYO files (not relevant for uPy)

	* `PEP 489 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/>`_ : redesigning extension module loading
